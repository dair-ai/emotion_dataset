# Emotion Dataset

This is a dataset that can be used for emotion classification. It has already been preprocessed based on the approach described in our [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1404/). It is also stored as a pandas dataframe and ready to be used in an NLP pipeline.

Note that the version of the data provided here corresponds to a six emotions variant that's meant to be used for educational and research purposes.

## Notebooks

Here is a [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nwCE6b9PXIKhv2hvbqf1oZKIGkXMTi1X#scrollTo=t23zHggkEpc-) showing how to use it for fine-tuning a pretrained language model for the task of emotion classification.

Here is another [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/176NSaYjc2eeI-78oLH_F9-YV3po3qQQO?usp=sharing) which shows how to fine-tune T5 model for emotion classification along with other tasks.

Here is also a hosted [fine-tuned model](https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/distilroberta-base-finetuned-sentiment) on HuggingFace which you can directly use for inference in your NLP pipeline.

Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks.",
